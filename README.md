Final Project

To run this project, open commnad prompt and change the directory to wherever this project is located. Run node server.js, and it will say that the local host is running on port 3000. The url for the api is http://localhost:3000. I stored the classes in arrays, and included their coursecode, time, days, and course names. Each major is separated into different blocks. On my html page, the selections link to the server depending on their major. The computer science option takes you to the page that hosts the data for that major.
